# Artificial_Neural_Network_Project
Task: In groups of 2, given a hand-written Roman numerals (from 1 to 10) dataset, can you design and train the best Multi-layer Perceptron (using scikitLearn library) that reports the best training and validation accuracies. Submission includes: Besides the code files, submit a detailed report describing how you explored the sklearn library, which functions you eventually used, the experimental settings you applied for each experiment of yours, including your input features, neural network architecture and parametric values, accuracy graphs etc. Finally, your informed analysis about which neural network setting was the best and why. If there are some experiments you could not try, what would they have looked like, if you had more time. Submission instructions: 1) Make a folder on your disk, its name should be Your Name(s)_Your ID(s). 2) It should only have the final code file(s) and final report. NO DATAset. 3) Zip it. 4) Upload on LMS before the deadline. Tip: Assume that the reader of your document is somebody who has not been a part of our classroom, so that person should be able to understand what you mean!
